# NeonatP
This project is part of a bachelor work at the [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/) conducted during the last academic semester 2022.

## Description
NeonatP is a web platform for the management of medical data related to pain in neonates. This organisation regroups the main building-blocks of the web platform.

## Architecture
The frontend was designed in Vue.js on a SPA (Single-Page-Application) model.

The backend follows a microservice architecture. The microservices developed in this project were realized with the SpingBoot framework, except for the secret manager where Vault is used.
